# DEEP-LEARNING-TO-PREDICT-PROTEIN-SECONDARY-STRUCTURE
The goal of the protein structure data is to predict the secondary structure and tertiary structure by using features derived from the 3D structure of the protein by using its amino acid sequence.
Machine learning has successfully used in various domains to train and predict the results with different data sets. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) serve as a foundation for deep learning, which is used in a wide range of applications, including healthcare, self-driving cars, Demographic and Election Predictions. In our project, deep learning architectures have been proposed to predict the performance of the protein structure, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict protein secondary structure. Compared to other studies that simply used amino acid sequences to predict protein secondary structure, we add two additional protein properties as features to deep learning models. The water solvent accessibility of a protein is its first characteristic and thermal stability as its second characteristics. The protein charge, which has two characteristicsâ€”positive charge (N-terminal) and negative charge is used for the protein structure prediction and next model will use the thermal stability we exploited to study the structure of the protein. Next, we integrate the characteristics of two proteins, and the deep learning model also makes use of them.
